<h1 class="titulo-index"> Partnerships with the <b> Help RPG Sheets </b> </h1>

<p>
This page is to talk about partnerships. Partnerships are always good, I've never seen a reason for anyone to obstruct a partner. It really makes no sense.

Currently the Help RPG has some partners who are somehow contributing to the Help RPG.Estes guys do a great job and I like Help the creator I am proud to telos as partners.
