<h1 class="titulo-index"> Using the website <b> Help RPG Sheets </b> </h1>
<p>
After made your registration on the site, you will find options for various types of registration. These entries can be classified as the RPG system available on the site. So you can make a record of any specific weapon or armor to use in your campaign or simply search for the same type of item made by other players.
</p>

<p>
In the registration page you will realize that all possible input fields are enabled for the different types of system. This means that you are not required to fill in all registration fields. Usually by default, only the term name is required in the registration act.
</p>

<p>
In addition to entries made through a long form as the RPG system chosen. You also have at your disposal a faster registration page, for only some fields must be filled. The plug for complete is reported in a single text field with options for formatting. Thus the form is not as extensive full fields and you can focus your registration form in a single field. It's like creating a record in the world.
</p>

<p>
If you wish, you can report the link to an external card that you have registered somewhere else and registers it in the help RPG.
</p>

<p>
You also realize that some records as weapons, armor, etc. will offer an image field so you better detail the item in which you are enrolling. This field is not required if leave empty your registered item will have no image. Another observation is that when you are editing an item, you must provide a picture again, because if not complete, your record will be blank.
</p>

<p>
You will also notice that within the administrative panel, some records are only available to view or download. This means that registered item is not yours and only the user who registered can edit it. However you can contact him via e-mail or facebook user if it wished to provide your profile to exchange information with other players.

<H2 class = "titulo-index"> Some frequently asked questions. </h1>
<p>
Below is a short list of frequently asked questions that users may have and possible sugest√£os to the site.
</p>
<h3> Is there a limit items, chips and etc? can register how much I want? </h3>
<p>
Yes! No Help RPG Sheets there is no limit for gun registration npumero, items, chips, etc. you will register. In fact desque not blind the limit that the hosting plan offers, it's all OK! lol
</p>

</p>
<h3> Its implement support more RPG systems? </h3>
<p>
Yes! Has as. However I do not know all RPG systems, so as far as possible I will try to add new systems to the site so that users can register new records for your favorite RPG system. Interestingly, send me tips as things could be done for a particular system. Ex: Which fields are important to register and etc.
</p>
<h3> It has to implement new features? </h3>
<p>
Yes! Has as. But it depends on the complexity of the thing. Unfortunately I do not have time to devote myself to the site 100%. In addition there are things that may be infeasible at this time for me, certain features can be simple to implement and not others. Thus everything depends on the complexity of the new suggested functionality.
</p>
<h3> Advertisements... Wow! that boring! </h3>
<p>
This site generates spending to keep it in the air. Thus the only way I found to offer this free tool for RPG players was monetizing this site. The links available for download are monetized, advertisements on the site are for the survival of the same. So try to understand it just fine.
