<h1 class = "titulo-index"> Foreign versions of the <b> Help RPG Sheets </b> </h1>
<p>
In addition to the native language of the site (Portuguese - Brazilian), the site offers an English version amaricano. Not a native English because this version was made by google translator.

<p>
The help RPG intends to support several other languages in order to reach a larger number of users. Thus, it can be expected that soon the option of more languages will be added to the site.
