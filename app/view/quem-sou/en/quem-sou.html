<h1 class = "titulo-index"> Hello! I am the <b> Goku </b>. Oops! not pear. </h1>
<p>
So guys I'm Maickon Rangel, I have 28 years and am the creator and administrator of RPG Help same page on facebook. The idea for the project came in 2013 when I created a desktop application called NpcCriador. Thereafter I came tweaking the system to the current state it is today.
</p>
<p>
The whole site programming was done by me and every day that passes always been trying to add a new feature that can add RPG value of people.
</p>
<p>
I have a Youtube channel where I try to explain the new utilities that create for the site. Also I talk about other interesting tools that meet there. If you like RPG advise that you register the channel.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, I am also fan of RPG and not find account tools that could help teachers and players in our native language I just embarking on this project. I know that many of the tools found are in English and not everyone is fluent enough in this language in order to use the tools productively as it should.
</p>
<p>
So I decided to try to gather any useful tool that I found the network here on my website. Also I'm always thinking and trying to come up with a utility that could help players and master something.
</p>
<p>
Currently the site is kept out of my pocket and even without some return still I really like what I do, because this site is one of my favorite pastimes. It is quite common I spend much of my weekend stuck in my room scheduling new tools, updating the site with new records or researching interesting utilities so you can add to the site.
</p>
<p>
Well folks, that's all I have to say so far. Have fun with the site and be a Helper!
